### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I felt more comfortable working with part 2 of this assignment and thought that I could try and implement one of the bonus user stories. I decided to implement the part where the user can tap on a posster and view a detail screen for that movie. Although I had already implementes this procedure with the TableViewCell, I had to implement it using a CollectionViewCell this time. Most of the steps were the same but I had to change a couple lines of code. I was unsure on how the deselectRow would transfer over to a CollectionViewCell. After some time and some thinking I was able to figure it out.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I felt a little overwhelmed with the topics being introduced with this assignment, but once I stepped back and really took the time to understand the concepts, everything became clearer.
